# How XP is given for this bot
XP depends on both the frequency of your messages and the length of your message.

For at most one message per minute, you get a random (number) amount of XP between 6 and 10.

For each message you send, if your message exceeds 50 characters, then for each additional character (above 50), you get 0.1XP

XP is kept only for a rolling 3 day period.
